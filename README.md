# Project Title: Chatbot-based Time Management Website

## Project Scope
This project aims to create a web-based productivity tool that integrates a chatbot to help users plan, reflect, and manage their time effectively. The system will allow users to input tasks, interact with a chatbot for time management advice, and visualize productivity history.

## Target Users
- Students who want to manage study sessions better
- Remote workers who need time structure
- Self-learners with goal-oriented daily plans

## Features
- Interactive chatbot (via OpenAI API) for time management suggestions
- Task input interface with tracking
- Mood / reflection input per task
- Basic data visualization (e.g., daily summary)
- Local storage using SQLite
