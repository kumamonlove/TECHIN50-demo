# Chatbot-based Time Management Website

## Project Objective:
### Background
Current time management apps often require users to input their schedules in specific formats, which can be cumbersome. Additionally, they lack the ability to provide personalized time management strategies based on individual time usage patterns.

### Objective
By integrating a fine-tuned Chatbot, this project aims to explore a new form of time management software that allows users to plan and record their time using natural language and personal expressions. For example, an input like “Re 3h” can be interpreted as “reading for 3 hours” and logged into the database, making it easier for users to keep records. Additionally, the Chatbot can supervise and give feedback using a personalized language style, and generate scenario-based interactive data visualizations to analyze users' time management, offering tailored suggestions accordingly.

## Target User:
Users who need time management but are dissatisfied with existing tools.
